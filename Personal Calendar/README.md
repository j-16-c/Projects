## Personal Calendar
# Welcome to the repository for my personal calendar!

This program was originally written using IntelliJ, to be exported as an exectuable JAR file for ease of use.

This program is intended for use in educational contexts, as tasks are meant to be set as assignments that need to be done. 
However, it can be used for external purposes as well, and normal tasks and reminders can be set as well. Additionally, this
program allows for users to input estimated times needed to complete assignments along with in how many days the user would
like for these assignments to be completed, and the program automatically distributes the time evenly over the days specified
and adds them to the daily reminders. Furthermore, to incentivize the user to complete tasks, when tasks are completed the user
gains tokens, which can be used to play the simple games included with the program.
